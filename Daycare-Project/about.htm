			<h1>About Us</h1><img src="img/about.jpg" style="float:right" alt="">
				<p>God’s Little Treasures is a Christian preschool and childcare 
					center. We understand that you want your child’s first experience to be 
					life changing. So we offer a happy, nurturing and positive environment 
					where your child will have the opportunity to make friends, play, and 
					learn new things while having fun. We offer the children a place to grow
					and learn through exploration and play to develop self esteem, which 
					will prepare them for their adventure in God’s big world.</p>
					<p>Here at God’s Little Treasures, our philosophy is that children need
					to have a safe, loving, and positive atmosphere within a supervised 
					educational setting. This setting includes the environment, classroom as
					well as indoor and outdoor play areas. We believe that children need to
					be encouraged in developing their understanding of God, as it relates 
					to their life and world. They need to understand and participate in an 
					active learning process, which enhances their learning and growth, while
					providing social interaction and enrichment in a quality culturally 
					sensitive setting.</p>
					<p>God’s Little Treasures is open to all children regardless to race, 
					church affiliations or creed. Children in God’s Little Treasures 
					programs are supervised at all time by an adult with teacher or 
					assistant teacher qualifications.</p>
					<p>When accepting a child in God’s Little Treasures program, our goal 
					is to provide each child with the best possible environment through 
					excellence in education, love and care.</p>
					<p>Our staff is dedicated to providing each child with a curriculum 
					that is developmentally appropriate and a stimulating atmosphere that is
					balanced to promote each child’s physical, intellectual, social, 
					emotional and spiritual needs during the time s/he participates in our 
					program.</p>
					<p>God’s Little Treasures is licensed by the State of Minnesota and 
					complies with the standards set forth by the State of Minnesota 
					Department of Human Services (DHS) and the Minnesota Board of Education.
					You can contact the Minnesota DHS, Division of Licensing at (651) 
					431-6500.</p>
					<p>We serve boys and girls from 6 weeks through Pre-kindergarten age. 
					Our license capacity is no more than 66 children at any given time. We 
					currently can serve up to 8 infants, 14 toddlers and 44 preschoolers. We
					are open year round (except major holidays) Monday through Friday from 
					7:00 AM to 6:00 PM.</p>
