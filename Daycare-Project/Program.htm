			<h1>Program &amp; Curriculum</h1><img src="img/program.jpg" style="float:right" alt="">
			<h2>Infant Class (6 Weeks - 15 Months)</h2>
			<p>Our Infant program allows babies to grow and learn every day. We 
			offer a safe and nurturing home away from home where children can 
			explore and make new discoveries. Children learn through play and our 
			program is designed to provide infants with the skills that serve as 
			building blocks for a lifetime of learning. We are committed to making 
			this first transition away from home easy and natural for you and your 
			child. We offer daily reports so you can keep track of your child’s day 
			here at the center. Our daily infant reports include complete daily 
			feeding and diapering history.</p>
			<h2>Toddler Class (16 Months - 3 Years)</h2>
			<p>Our Toddler program helps children build friendships, self-esteem, 
			and curiosity. Our staff will assist them to explore their world in a 
			safe and nurturing environment. Each day is filled with fun activities 
			that excite and help children develop in ways that give them the comfort
			 and confidence to grow and develop both cognitively and socially. We 
			offer daily reports so you can keep track of your child’s day here at 
			the center. We utilize 123 Learn (Parent Aware approved) curriculum to 
			lay a foundation for learning letters, numbers and colors.</p>
			<h2>Pre - Kindergarten Class (3 Years - 5 Years)</h2>
			<p>Our Pre-K program helps children gain more self-esteem, so they feel
			 ready to take on the world. Our Pre-K program enhances that confidence 
			by providing activities to help children become problem solvers and 
			develop a love of lifelong learning. This is a time when children are 
			making connections between what they know and what they are learning. 
			Through independent exploration, structured activities, and hands-on 
			learning, children develop a variety of skills and knowledge. They learn
			 to participate in routines, make decisions, and planning techniques. We
			 help prepare your child for Kindergarten in a private or public 
			setting. We offer daily reports so you can keep track of your child’s 
			day here at the center. We use 123 Learn (Parent Aware approved) 
			curriculum and other tools to teach letters, numbers and to prepare them
			 for reading and basic math.</p>
